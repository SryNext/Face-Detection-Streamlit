# Face Detection Streamlit

This repository contains a Python application that utilizes the Streamlit framework to perform real-time face detection in images and video streams. The application uses a pre-trained face detection model to detect human faces, and draws bounding boxes around them for easy visualization.

## Installation
To run this application, you must first install the required Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install all necessary packages, including Streamlit and the OpenCV and dlib computer vision libraries.

## Usage
To run the application, simply navigate to the root directory of this repository in your terminal, and run the following command:

streamlit run app.py

This will start the Streamlit application, and open a new browser window with the user interface. From here, you can upload images or select a video stream source to perform real-time face detection.
